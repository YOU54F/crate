== DESCRIPTION

Crate is a developer tool to help package up your application as a custom static
build of the ruby interpreter plus all dependent binary extensions.  All the
pure ruby code (the ruby application, the ruby stdlib, etc ) is packed into one
or more SQLite databases.

The final distributable pieces are a single executable and a few SQLite
databases which can be then wrapped up appropriately as an OS X App; a self
extracting executable for Windows; a shar archive, rpm or tarball for Unixes.

== INSTALL

gem install crate

== SYNOPSIS

First, cratetify your application or gem:

  crateify ./myapp           # => path to local project
  crateify ./mygem-1.0.0.gem # => path to local gem
  crateify mygem             # => remotely fetches

Then enter the newly project/gem directory and build

  cd myapp
  crate

Wait for everything to complete, it could be a while depending on your system.
You will have a new directory in the app or gem directory called 'crate'.  In
'crate/dist' will be the items to distribute.

  crate/dist/myapp
  crate/dist/lib.db
  crate/dist/app.db
